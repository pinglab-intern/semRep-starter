### Preparing Foundation
- Create an account at NLM/UMLS account
- Get Familiar with the following:
    - [MeSH tree](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/treeView)
    - [ICD codes](https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en) 
    - [Uniprot](https://www.uniprot.org), 
    - [Reactome](https://reactome.org), 
    - [Drugbank](https://www.drugbank.ca) etc
- Install Python([Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual))
- Install [Neo4J](https://neo4j.com/) and take available tutorials
- Get Familiar with [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) NLP package in Python
- Get introductory idea of Machine Learning from [Scikit](https://scikit-learn.org/stable) Learn and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) (Specially, LSTM)

### Project Detail
- Prepare required CVD entities (e.g, UMLS dictionary, MeSH Tree, ICD Tree, Proteins, Genes, RNASeq, Drugs)
- Explore semRep for CVD cases with CVD entities
- Prepare a CVD KG from available SPO triplets
- Create a Graph association Matrix and artifacts
- Build and test LSTM models
- Analyse the result
- Present the result
- Organize the documentation with Mkdocs
